In this workshop, I learnt about constructor overloading. 
I also learn about using strncpy() function which only copies string up to certain elements. 
I learnt a lot about memory leaks and how to prevent them. I also learnt that each and everything that is dynamically allocated has to be deallocated. 
Its best to keep track of things which are getting dynamically allocated so that its easy to deallocate them. 
I also came to know about the print() function that returns cout object.
I also got hands on experience on the output formatting using  setw(), left, right and fill(). 
I also came to know about logic which calculates the length of the integer variable. 
We also ensure that the class members donâ€™t have any garbage value by putting them in safe empty state. 
After copying the elements of one array to other, we must set the next character to null terminator. 
I learnt how to return reference to current object.
I also learnt about using the this operator.

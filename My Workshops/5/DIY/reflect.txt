I learnt that Operator keyword is used for an overloaded operation. 
In overloaded operation, the left operand is always the current object. 
We also use temporary objects for making the operation local and distinct.
I also came to know that using overloaded operators make the code must compact and efficient and easier maintain. 
I also learnt to create temporary objects by the execution of member function of the other object. I also learnt that returning a reference to object can be used with operands such as assignment or pre and post fix if they directly change the object. 
All these things reduce the code repetition which is much easier to read and manageable. 
I also learnt about the copy constructor and the assignment operator. 
I came to know about the copy constructor which is used for copying a block of information and storing it to another location without any changes to the older block.
It can be very handy for comparisons for the block of information.

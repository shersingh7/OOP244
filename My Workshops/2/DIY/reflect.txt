In this workshop I learned who to use dynamic memory with the pointers and how to allocate and deallocate them. 
We use dynamic memory allocation so that most of the platforms are able to use the application.
Not every platform has huge memory. So, dynamic memory allocation is very important when developing for very small platforms with limited memory.
We should always deallocate memory so that the ram is free of that allocated memory which prevents the memory leaks.
We use delete [ ] to deallocate the memory. The allocated memory should always be deallocated under the scope of the pointer. 
We should allocate new dynamic memory whenever we increase the size of the existing array as we need to add new items in that array 
which is insufficient to add anything more than its allocated before.
There will be no memory leak if the static memory is allocated to the application during run time.
The compiler will always know which function to use. It will match the number of parameters they we have passed. 
So it will know which function to call.

We should never keep any variable with undefined values. It can cause many bugs in the program. 
The best way to void this is by setting them to safe empty state. 

For making them empty we assign them to a impossible value.

We should always deallocate every dynamic memory that is created during the run-time.

Structures are public and they do not have any private data. 
So, we can access them without needing any member function. 

Classes have both public and private data. So, we need to make member functions so that we can access the private data.
We access the member function by typing the class name followed by :: and the function_name().
We define the public members by typing public:. All the member functions in the class are private by default.

We set the int/float/double output precision by cout << set.precision(VALUE);

We can also set the width of the output by cout.width(WIDTH);

We fill the output by any character by using cout.fill(‘CHARACTER’);

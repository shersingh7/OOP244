From this workshop I came to know that namespace is a scope for entities that it encloses.
Its purpose is to avoid same identifier naming conflicts for different variables.
We also need header files when we need to access objects in an external library that we do not want to recompile or avoid interfering with.
I also came to know that we should never compile header files as we will include the header files in .cpp file and while compiling, it will automatically compile them. 
If we compile header files, then header files will compile twice, and the compiler will give errors.
We should never include .cpp files in other files as when compiling if we include them it will recompile and create a duplicate file.
I also learnt the benefits of putting source code in modules. 
As a well-designed module is highly cohesive and loosely coupled and it's easy to make changes to a module instead of whole source code when you are working with millions of lines.
From this workshop I also learned how to create modules and use them effectively and to safeguards the header files.

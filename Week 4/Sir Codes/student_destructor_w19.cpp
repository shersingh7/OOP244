/* Concepts
   1. C++ class: a data type
   2. C++ object: an instance of a C++ class; a variable
   3. C++ class = DECLARATIONS (.h) + IMPLEMENATION (.cpp)
      a) declarations of private data members
      b) declarations of public member functions
      c) declarations of constructors and a destructor
      d) implemenation of the member functions, constructros and destructor
   4. C++ object = priavate data members + public member functions
